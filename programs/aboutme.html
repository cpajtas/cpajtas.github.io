<p class="paragraphs">Hi there! My name is Chris Pajtas. I am a Computer Science Major here at Eastern Michigan. I just recently graduated from Washtenaw Community College, with my Associates in Java Programming. I spent half of my college career there and I am looking forward to spending (hopefully) two more here at Eastern.</p>

<p class="paragraphs">I grew up in Hartland, Michigan and I am currently living in Ypsilanti. I figured I should live closer to campus so that I do not need to make the 45-minute drive back and forth, especially since I have 4 days of classes. I also work at Best Buy in Ann Arbor, so if you want a TV, you should stop by!</p>

<p class="paragraphs">I am trying to make life more interesting by trying new things, whether I fail or succeed. Odds are, I wouldnâ€™t be able to succeed in any of these if I never even tried. I have plenty of hobbies and interests, which include hockey, guitar, and photography.</p>

<ul class="bulletPoint"> 

    <li><p>I used to play hockey in second grade, but then just quit because I did not like putting the gear on and off. One thing I realized recently is that I missed the ice and being able to skate around. So, I decided to start going to some open skate sessions. Soon after, I bought the gear and then moved into some drop in leagues. I usually just play Friday nights, but I am trying to find more games!</p></li>

    <li><p>Guitar is something that can really help me lose my mind in song. I could spend hours in my room trying to learn songs by ear and jamming out. Now, I need lots of practice, but I know in the long run it is going to be worth it. I really enjoy heavy metal and most rock genres! <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7aj4gUvr62daFDkqQf3zXk?si=4hz9wCgKTWiZK9Au9DR9zw">Click here</a> for a workout playlist I compiled!</p></li>

    <li><p>I have always had an interest in the natural landscapes and astronomy. My phone was always my camera, I took sunsets and nature pictures. Now I am just beginning to start taking some pics of the stars and nature. I moved on from the phone camera, to the <a href="https://www.sony.com/electronics/interchangeable-lens-cameras/ilce-6000-body-kit"
	>Sony A6000 Mirrorless</a> camera.</p></li>

<p class="paragraphs">One of the biggest dreams I have is to have a home, that I design myself, on many acres. I want access to woods and a lake front, preferably on one of our great lakes! On top of that, I hope to adopt a German Shepherd Husky mix.</p>

<p class="paragraphs">In order to be able to do any of that, I do need a stable job and source of income. So, I have a goal to become a Database Administrator at some point in a few years after I graduate. Hopefully, I will be able to work from home most of the time as well!</p>
